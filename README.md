# ability_tests

Collection of various problems designed to test a developer's profiency on given subjects.

# Know your Javascript

Knowledge test of the Javascript language. Most tests have multiple assertions and will only show up as succesful if all assertions pass.
Do save the work of the candidate because we will look into the details of each test even if they don't pass.

## Run

1. npm run test:kyj

## How to evaluate

The idea here is for the candidate to go through most of the test. It's okay not to finish it.

- Collapse all tests and have the candidate expand them one by one so that he doesn't get help from further tests
- Evaluate the candidate on his knowledge and ability to finding the answer by making him talk through the exercises (answer is \_ because ..., I'm not sure because ...)
- The candidate is allowed to ask questions as long as the answer is not the expected result of the test, however make sure to keep track of what questions were asked.
- Fill in the following appreciation form:
  - Overall knowledge of the candidate
  - Ability of the candidate to solve an issue
  - Proficiency while writing code / thinking in javascript
  - Confidence of the candidate when providing an answer, before seeing the test results

NB: On the "Higher Order Functions" tests, if the candidate uses simple loops and outer scope variables, you should challenge him to finder other ways to do it.
The goal is to test his knowledge of functions such as forEach, find, map, filter and reduce.
